# FacialRecognitionFlask
A Webflask application that does a simple facial recognition, using any rtsp available, makes comparison to a database and send webhooks of matched faces. This webhooks contain the names of those detected in real time, so you're able to integrate them with an automation system like Home Assistant, and do all kind's of little things, like making Alexa say some welcoming phrase and sorts.

It's using the deepface library and its functions to do all facial recognition tasks.
